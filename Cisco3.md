# Exploring Wireless Networking

### Differences in WLAN and LAN

*	WLANs use radio waves as the physical layer
	*	Use CSMA/CA instead of CSMA/CD for media access
	*	2-way radio (half-duplex) communication
*	Radio waves have problems not found on wires
	*	Connectivity issues:
		*	Coverage problems
		*	Interference, noise
	*	Privacy issues
*	Access points are shared devices similar to an Ethernet hub for shared bandwidth.
*	WLANs must meet country-specific RF regulations.

### RF Transmission

*	Radio frequencies are radiated into the air via antenna, creating radio waves
*	Ofjects can affect radio wave propagation resulting in
	*	Reflection
	*	Scattering
	*	Absorption
*	Higher frequencies allow higher data rates, however have a shorter range

## WLAN Organizations

1.	ITU-R:
	*	regulates the RF used in wireless
2.	IEEE:
	*	802.11 documents wireless technical standards
3.	Wi-Fi Alliance
	*	Global nonprofit industry trade association
	*	Promotes wireless growth through interoperability certification
	*	Promote & certify standards such as WPA and WPA2

	*	Products include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, dual-band products, and security testing
	*	Provides assurance to customers regarding migration and integraion

**Cisco is a founding member of the Wi-Fi Alliance**

# Understanding WLAN Security

## Security Threats
1.	War Driver - find open networks for free internet access
2.	Hackers - Exploit weak privacy measure to view sensitive WLAN info and break into WLANs
3.	Employees - Plug consumer-grade APs into company ethernet ports to create their own WLANs

### Mitigating Threats
1.	Authentication
	*	ensure that legitimate clients assocaite with trusted APs
	*	RADIUS
2.	Encryption
	*	protect data as it is transmitted and received
	*	WEP, WPA, WPA2
3.	Intrusion Prevention System
	*	track and mitigate unauthorized access and network attacks.
	
## Evolution of Wireless Security
![Wireless Security](images/securities.png)

	TKIP	- 	Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
	AES		- 	Advanced Encryption Standard
	CCMP	- 	Counter Mode with CBCâ€“MAC
	EAP 	- 	Extensible Authentication Protocol
	LEAP	- 	Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol
	PEAP	- 	Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol

## Wireless Client Association
1.	APs send out beacons announcing SSID, data rates, and other info
2.	Client scans all channels
3.	Client listens for beacons and responses from APs
4.	Client associates to AP with strongest signal
5.	Client repeats scan if signal becomes low to reassociate to another AP (roaming)
6.	During association, SSID, MAC address, and security settings are sent from the client to the AP, and checked by the AP

**802.1x is an authenticator**
1.	Client checks w/ AP
2.	AP checks with RADIUS server
3.	AP lets client know that their credentials work
4.	Client gains access

### WPA Modes
--------------
![WPA](images/wpa.png)

### Encryption types
1.	WEP
	*	Basic encryption
	*	Weak, easy to crack
2.	TKIP
	*	Solution to avoid WEP
	*	Part of WPA
3.	AES
	*	Stronger and most resource-consuming
	*	Part of WPA2 and 802.11i
4.	VPN
	*	Encrypted connection between private networks over a public network
	*	DES, 3DES, AES, SSL

# Implementing a WLAN

## 802.11 Topology Building Blocks

1.	Ad hoc mode
	*	IBSS(Independent Basic Service Set) - Mobile clients connect directly without an intermediate AP
2	Infrastructure mode
	*	BSS(Basic Service Set) - Mobile clients use a single AP for connecting to each other or to wired network resources
	*	ESS(Extended Service Set) - 2 or more BSSs are connected by a common distribution system
	
### Data rates and range
![Data rates & range](images/datarates-range.png)

## AP Configuration

1.	Basic parameters:
	*	IP address, mask, and gateway needed
	*	Decide on Wireless protocol (g, b/g, a, n, or Mixed Mode)
	*	Channel (automatic or static)
	*	Radio power
2.	Security parameters:
	*	SSID
	*	Authentication method - WPA, or WPA2 PSK
	*	Encryption method - TKIP or AES
	
## Steps to implement WLAN
1.	Verify local wired operation - DHCP & ISP
2.	Install AP
3.	Configure AP - SSID, no security (to ensure that clients can connect)
4.	Connect a client
5.	Verify WLAN operation
6.	Configure security - WPA, WPA2
7.	Verify WLAN operation

### Wireless Clients

*	Wireless Zero Configuration:
	*	Default on XP or later
	*	Limited features for basic PSK
	*	Verify that users have correct encryption type and password
*	Cisco Compatible Extensions Programs
	*	Accelerated feature deployment of 3rd party clients
	*	Wide deployment of various vendors
*	Cisco Secure Services Client
	*	Enterprise full-featured wireless client supplicant
	*	Wired and wireless
	
### Common WLAN issues

**Most problems are due to incorrect configuration**
*	Verify that AP has latest firmware
*	Verify channel
*	Verify users have correct encryption and password

*Other common problems*
*	RF interference
*	Not connected
*	Radio disabled on client
*	Poor antenna location

# VoIP Requirements

**VoiP Phones are connected to network**

	Some wired
	Some wireless

## Requirements in Network

*	VoIP traffic has special requirements (bandwidth, priority, and small delay)
*	Use separate VLANs for IP telephony traffic and data traffic to avoid conflict; voice VLAN
*	Cisco IP phones are often PoE
*	WLAN design must take into consideration the density and implementation of VoIP devices
